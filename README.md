Hello! This repo is an exercise completed for the U of MN fullstack web dev bootcamp. 

Given some starter code, this assignment required altering a  book search engine website that is set up with standard express CRUD routes, and replacing it with graphql schemas and front-end graph ql queries and mutations in order to complete the same task more efficiently. In addition, this assignment uses JSON web tokens for authentication.
